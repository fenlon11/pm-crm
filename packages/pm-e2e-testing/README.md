## Q&A

#### Why there's `path.resolve()` everywhere?
That's thanks to differences in root directory when running tests using commands and using IDE. When running tests with commands, 
the root directory is `twenty/packages/pm-e2e-testing`, for IDE it depends on how someone sets the configuration. This way, it
ensures that no matter which IDE or OS Shell is used, the result will be the same.
